# Joomla - JS Async
Choose third party javascript files to load asynchronously in the head.

Loading javascript asynchronously affects page download times and search engine rankings. Joomla does not come with an out of the box solution for choosing scripts to load asynchronously. This is especially true for scripts added to Joomla by third party extensions. The JS Async plugin solves this problem by giving you a simple way to pick scripts to load asyncrhronously using the Joomla admin panel. 

# To Install:
Download the zip file included in the repository and upload it as the extension package file using the extension manager. 

# To Use:
1. Once the plugin is installed correctly, go to Extensions > Plugins and search for "JS Async". 
2. Click on the plugin name. If it is not enabled, please enable it now.
3. In the "File Name(s)" field, list the file names of scripts you would like to load asynchronously. You can also use keywords included in the file names. For instance, if you wanted all jQuery files to load asynchrously you could include just "jquery" in the File Name(s) field. Separate multiple file names or keywords with a comma. 
4. Save. Be sure to double check the plugin is enabled in order for it to work.
